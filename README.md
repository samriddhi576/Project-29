Ingredients of Bombay grilled sandwich
2 slices brown bread
1 handful mint leaves
2 pinches salt
1 small tomato
1 medium boiled potato
1/4 teaspoon chaat masala
1/4 cup water
1 handful coriander leaves
2 green chilli
1 medium cucumber
1 small onion
2 tablespoon butter
2 wedges cheddar cheese

Steps to make sandwich

Step 1 Slice the veggies
To prepare this yummy sandwich, peel and slice the onion and cucumber in a round shape. Wash the tomatoes and cut round slices of it as well.

Step 2 Make green chutney
Next, wash and chop the coriander and mint leaves to prepare the green chutney for the sandwich. Add them along with green chillies and salt in a mixer jar and blend to a smooth paste, and try not to add too much water.

Step 3 Assemble the sandwich
Trim the bread from all sides or you can keep it if you wish and apply butter on one bread, then apply the green chutney all over. Next, place the cucumber, tomato, onion slices over the bread slice along with the potato slice. Sprinkle salt over the veggies along with chaat masala. Cover this slice with the other slice.

Step 4 Grill the sandwich and serve hot
Once you are done with placing the sandwich, spread the grated cheese over it. Grill the sandwich for around 2-3 minutes. Once done, cut into pieces and serve hot.
